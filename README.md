# HeartDiseasePrediction
Developed this desktop application using python.

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It is a rapidly evolving field with a wide range of applications and has become an essential part of various industries and technologies.

PURPOSE:
